# MyEngine ChangeLog

## v0.1.2-beta (2025/12/17)

### 🔧 Performance Optimization
- **Render Command Pool**: Refactored command pool system to improve render command reuse efficiency
- **Sub-pool Mechanism**: Implemented dynamic sub-pool allocation based on CPU core count to reduce lock contention
- **Memory Allocation**: Integrated `std::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource` for optimized memory allocation
- **Data Structure**: Replaced `std::deque` with `std::vector` to improve memory locality
- **Atomic Operations**: Adopted lock-free atomic variable polling for sub-pool selection, balancing multi-thread load

### 🐛 Fixes
- **Window Closure Crash**: Fixed CommandPool destructor to resolve crash when closing window
- **Thread Safety**: Enhanced thread safety mechanisms to avoid data races during concurrent access

### 💡 Technical Improvements
- **Command Reuse**: Implemented command object `reset()` method supporting parameterized reset
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized command batch execution mode to improve rendering efficiency
- **Resource Management**: Enhanced resource release mechanism to prevent memory leaks
